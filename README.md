# PorTis

This repository contains the code for the paper "PorTis: A biological phenotype classification dataset
for benchmarking nanopore signal-based protein analysis". It contains code for loading, analyzing, and
preprocessing the PorTis dataset as well as the tissue classification model training and inference code.

Authors: Cailin Winston, Marc Exp√≤sit, Jeff Nivala

## Installation and setup

First clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:uwmisl/PorTis.git
```

Then, setup the Python environment with the packages/dependencies needed to run the code in this repository:

```
cd PorTis
conda env create -f env.yml
```

Then, activate the conda environment:

```
conda activate portis
```

Ensure that you have Jupyter notebook to run the notebooks in `/notebooks`.

## Usage

To run any of the notebooks, open them in Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions/comments in the cells.

To run the benchmarks for the signal event classification (Task 1) and "real-time" sample classification (Task 2), run either `1d_cnn.py` or `2d_cnn.py` from the `/scripts` directory.

Any combination of the flags `--to_train`, `--to_eval`, and `--to_sim` can be specified, as long as at least one is specified. Running with the `--to_train` flag will train a new model. Running with the `--to_eval` flag with evaluate the model on the specified test set; either `--to_train` must also be specified to train a new model to evaluate or a `--model_path` to an already trained model can be provided. Running with the `--to_sim` flag will run the "real-time" sample classification simulation.
